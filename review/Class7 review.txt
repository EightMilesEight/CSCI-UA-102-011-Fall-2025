-- Algorithmic Analysis --
What does f(n) = O(g(n)) mean?
Name a method that is O(1), O(log(n)), O(n), and O(n^2).


-- Stacks and Queues -- 
What's the difference between a stack and a queue?
How can you implement these ADTs?

-- Search --
Write out binary search as a recursive algorithm (don't worry if you don't know what this means). Write out the argument that the complexity is O(log(n))
